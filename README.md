# Chat with PDF using Gemini

## Aim

The purpose of this project is to build a system that allows users to upload PDF documents and interact with them through a conversational interface. The application uses Google's Gemini AI model to process the content of the PDF and answer user queries based on the document's context. This system aims to facilitate quick and efficient extraction of information from large documents, making it useful for various applications like research, document analysis, and legal or financial data retrieval.

## Methodology

The system follows a series of steps to extract and process text from PDF documents and provide answers to user queries:

1. **PDF Text Extraction**: When a PDF document is uploaded by the user, the system reads the document using the `PyPDF2` library and extracts its text content.

2. **Text Chunking**: The extracted text is then split into smaller, manageable chunks using the `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` from the `langchain` library. This is essential for managing large PDFs and optimizing performance for similarity search.

3. **Text Vectorization**: The text chunks are converted into vectors using `GoogleGenerativeAIEmbeddings` (powered by the Gemini model). These vectors represent the text in a mathematical format that allows for efficient similarity searching.

4. **Vector Store**: The vectors are stored in a FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) index, which allows for fast retrieval of relevant documents based on the similarity to the user's query.

5. **Conversational Chain**: When the user asks a question, the system searches the vector store for relevant document chunks. It then passes the matched content to the Gemini model (through the `ChatGoogleGenerativeAI`), which generates a response to the question.

6. **User Interaction**: The user interacts with the system via a Streamlit interface, where they can upload PDF documents, submit queries, and receive responses based on the content of the documents.

## Libraries Used

- **Streamlit**: Provides the web-based interface for users to upload PDFs and interact with the application.
- **PyPDF2**: Used to extract text from the uploaded PDF files.
- **langchain**: A powerful library that provides tools for natural language processing (NLP), text splitting, and chaining AI models for question answering.
- **google-generativeai**: Used to interact with the Google Gemini AI model for generating embeddings and answering questions.
- **langchain_google_genai**: A specialized library to interface with Googleâ€™s Gemini models for embeddings and chat-based interactions.
- **FAISS**: A library for efficient similarity search and vector store management, used to retrieve relevant document chunks based on user queries.
- **python-dotenv**: Loads environment variables such as API keys securely from a `.env` file.

## Evaluation Metric

The effectiveness of the system can be evaluated using the following metrics:

- **Response Accuracy**: Measures the precision and correctness of the answers generated by the system. This is determined by comparing the AI's response to the correct information in the document.
- **Query Response Time**: The time it takes for the system to process the uploaded PDFs, index the content, and respond to user queries.
- **Scalability**: The ability of the system to handle large PDF files efficiently without significant degradation in performance.
- **User Satisfaction**: Can be measured based on user feedback on the usefulness and accuracy of the responses provided by the system.

## Results

The system successfully performs the following tasks:

- **PDF Text Extraction**: The application can extract text from various types of PDF files and handle both short and long documents.
- **Efficient Text Chunking**: The text from PDFs is properly chunked into smaller, more manageable pieces, allowing for accurate and efficient similarity searches.
- **Vector Search**: The FAISS vector store is able to quickly search and retrieve relevant document chunks based on user queries.
- **Accurate Answers**: The Gemini model, integrated with the `langchain` framework, generates accurate and context-aware responses to user questions.

For example, when asked about specific details in the document, such as dates, names, or other data points, the system retrieves and provides the exact information from the document chunks.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates an efficient approach for interacting with PDF documents using AI. By combining the capabilities of the Google Gemini model with vector search and text chunking, the system provides an effective solution for extracting and answering questions from large PDFs. The application is scalable, flexible, and can be adapted to handle various types of document-based queries.

## Future Work

1. **Multi-Document Support**: Currently, the system works with multiple PDFs, but the next step would be to integrate advanced processing features for handling mixed file types (e.g., Word documents, scanned PDFs with OCR).
  
2. **Enhanced Text Preprocessing**: Improving the text extraction and chunking process for better handling of complex documents, such as scanned images or documents with multiple languages.
  
3. **Optimized Vector Store**: Implementing distributed or cloud-based FAISS indexing to handle large-scale data and improve performance for enterprise-level applications.

4. **Interactive Visualization**: Adding features for users to visualize the document structure or navigate through document sections to improve the user experience.

5. **Question Handling Enhancement**: Developing more advanced question handling capabilities, such as multi-turn conversations where context is carried forward between multiple queries.

6. **Cloud Deployment**: Deploying the application to a cloud platform (AWS, GCP, or Azure) for better scalability and performance.
